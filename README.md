# SearchInsertPosition
Search Insert Position

This Java program provides a solution for finding the search insert position of a target value within a sorted array. If the target is found in the array, the program returns the index of the first occurrence. If the target is not found, it returns the index where it would be inserted in order to maintain the sorted order of the array.

Implementation
The solution is implemented in a single class Solution with a method searchInsert. The method accepts two arguments:

nums (an integer array): a sorted array with distinct values
target (an integer): the target value to search for in the array
The searchInsert method performs a binary search on the input array to locate the target value or determine the appropriate insert position.
